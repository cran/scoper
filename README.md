SCOPer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPer provides a computational framework for B cell clones identification
from adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) datasets. 
Three models are included (identical, hierarchical, and spectral) 
that perform clustering among sequences of BCRs/IGs (B cell receptors/immunoglobulins) 
which share the same V gene, J gene and junction length. SCOPer is part of the 
[Immcantation](http://immcantation.readthedocs.io) analysis framework.

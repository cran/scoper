SCOPer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCOPer (Spectral Clustering for clOne Partitioning) provides a computational framework 
for unsupervised identification B cell clones from adaptive immune receptor repertoire 
sequencing (AIRR-Seq) datasets. This method performs spectral clustering of the B cell 
receptor (BCR) junction region within groups of BCR sequences sharing the same V gene, 
J gene, and junction length. Rather than a fixed threshold, SCOPe uses an adaptive 
threshold for clustering sequences to determine the local sequence neighborhood, 
which offers an improvement in both the sensitivity and specificity over a simple fixed 
threshold for all junction lengths. SCOPer is part of the 
[Immcantation](http://immcantation.readthedocs.io) analysis framework.
